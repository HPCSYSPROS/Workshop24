**Abstract:**
Recent years have brought about a sense of urgency regarding global environmental health and this shines attention on the environmental impact of modern computing data centers. These are mostly powered by electricity originating from carbon sources. In addition to the general concern for the environment, modern data centers are only increasing in their thirst for power. The latest data center applications and the latest foundation machine leaning models are examples of this. In 2021, the Georgia Institute of Technology transitioned into a consumption-based model for its centralized computing resources and further adopted SLURM for cluster management and for job scheduling. This transition resulted in greater utilization, among other metrics, than with the prior system based on Torque/Moab.
