**Abstract:**
Login nodes, also known as interactive nodes, are an essential component of high-performance computing (HPC) environments. Covering a range of different use cases, they provide users of a cluster with flexibility when developing and running programs. However, the resource management of these shared machines is an ongoing problem within the community, as each institution has different requirements of these nodes. In most cases, these nodes are shared simultaneously by multiple users, and providing users with freedom and fairness has proved to be a difficult task. To address these challenges, we introduce Arbiter, a software suite for setting and enforcing resource usage policies on Linux nodes via cgroups. In this paper we discuss the previous version of Arbiter, and the updates and improvements we have made in the new Arbiter 3.
