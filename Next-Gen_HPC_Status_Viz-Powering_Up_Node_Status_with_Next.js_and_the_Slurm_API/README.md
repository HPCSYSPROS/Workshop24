**Abstract:**
This paper presents the transformation of Arizona State University's (ASU) user-facing high-performance computing (HPC) monitoring capabilities, i.e., on a significantly updated cluster node status dashboard deployed on ASU's HPC systems. The dashboard leverages modern JavaScript frameworks and direct Slurm API integration to address the growing needs of ASU's diverse and expanding HPC user community. We explore the motivations behind the dashboard's development, detail its technical implementation, and discuss how it accommodates the growing complexity of HPC environments while simplifying user and administrator interactions. The resulting system enhances the overall user experience, lowers the barrier of entry to HPC, and also better positions ASU's HPC resources for future growth, while marking a significant milestone in the progression of HPC resource visualization.
